### Hi, I'm Liza 👋 👩‍💻

## About me:
After four years of teaching English abroad in Colombia and Spain, I got my masters in Curriculum and Instruction at UW-Madison with certifications in Secondary English and English as a Second Language. I then spent a year teaching, managing, and advising international students at Wisconsin English as Second Language Institute. When the pandemic hit, I started exploring new career paths, and I fell in love with coding. Currently, I am becoming a Full Stack Web Developer at Lambda School. 

If I am not programming, I am likely 🥾 hiking, 📚 reading, or ✍️ working on my blog. If you would like to know more, feel free to get in touch! 

## ✍️ Blog & Writing: 
I enjoy writing about my experiences becoming a web developer. You can find my articles on my website at [lizapincsak.com](https://lizapincsak.com) as well as on [Medium](https://lizapincsak.medium.com).
